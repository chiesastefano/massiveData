            "|Myth & Middle-Earth: Exploring the Medieval Legends Behind J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings|&quot;As a long-term fan of JRR Tolkien and all things Middle-earth, I was very happy to pick up this concise and readable book tracing the main mythic sources that inspired Tolkien. Most books focus on the Norse and Germanic myths to the exclusion of all else, and while Dr. Jones covers these areas, she also goes well beyond to look at the Celtic myths of Ireland and Wales to complete the picture. Put this on your holiday shopping list if you're a fan of The Lord of the Rings!&quot;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n",

Tolkien's Lord of the Rings|Juggles large numbers of mythic references with some skill but not full confidence or accuracy, and doesn't really have a lot of insight. The book is also burdened with a Hildebrandt cover. I recommend David Colbert's &quot;The Magical Worlds of The Lord of the Ring&quot; for juvenile readers, or Anne C. Petty's &quot;Tolkien in the Land of Heroes&quot; for adults.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",
            "|The Lord of the Rings: A Dramatization (12 Audio Cassettes-Gift Boxed Edition)               |\"I enjoy these tapes and have in fact had them as long as I can remember (I'm 24). They're really well done, though I've never listened to any other audio production of a novel to know what to judge it against. Sometimes the tapes have unintentionally cheesy moments, but you laugh so hard it actually makes the tape more worth it.My favorite moment is in tape 1 of \"\"the Fellowship of the Ring\"\" where the once menacing Ring Wraith talks to Ham Gamgee about whether Frodo is \"\"here\"\". The whole conversations funny but the end where the Ring Wraith loses every hint of mysteriousness and darkness by very politely asking Ham \"\"Can you take a message?\"\" leaves me rolling every time.P.S.-To people only familiar with the films                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n",
            "|The Lord of the Rings: A Dramatization (12 Audio Cassettes-Gift Boxed Edition)               |This drama comes on twelve audio tapes and lasts about twelve hours. It was produced by The Mind's Eye and comes in a nicely carved wooden box. The narration has been for the most part nicely performed. Many of the voices have American accents, which sound rather out of place in the British speech of the book. The acting has generally been well-done, but there are a good many corny portions. Some of the voices, such as Samwise Gamgee for example, sound cartoonish. Frodo sounds like an ordinary grown man who could live anywhere in the USA, but his faithful friend and servant Sam sounds like a cartoon figure who sucked a couple of helium balloons before acting. Merry and Pippin have been done well. They have British accents and cartoonish voices. Sauron sounds absolutely terrible. The actor sounds like he is talking while breathing in and trying to become a baritone, which he is obviously not. Treebeard and the Ents, although rather corny, do a great job. Tom Bombadill is, as is the case in the book, quite jolly and merry, but he puts on a VERY, VEEEEEEEERRY corny act. Goldberry can't sing. The Elves have human voices, although they all do a nice job. Galadriel has a soft voice, but she seems to be reading from a script rather than sounding natural. The hobbits have diverse voices. Hamfast Gamgee the Gaffer has a quaky, quavering voice. Some hobbits have voices like Bugs Bunny and his pals. Some have accented human voices. Saruman does NOT have the regal, low voice that he is supposed to have. Christopher Lee would have been a far better choice. However, there are many great actors. Aragorn, Gandalf, Th&eacute;oden, &Eacute;omir, Denethor, Bilbo, Gimli and Legolas all do a nice job. Gimli has a somewhat deep and gruff voice. Gollum or Sm&eacute;agol is something altogether different. The actor who plays him does a nice job, but his voice sounds just a tad too human. He sometimes outdoes his own voice ability through having to scream, hiss and weep so much. The music is Classical in nature. The main problem lies in the fact that there was little music produced. It was cut and pasted all over the place. I guess there might be a half hour to an hour of music all told. Because of this there is very little theme development unlike in the BBC dramatization. This is rather disconcerting for those who like a good sound track with lots of strong thematic development and emphasis. Many of the sounds have been used over and over and over again. The same battle cries are heard at Helm's Deep, Rohan, and Minas Tirith. The same Orcs must have been at all the battles too because the same sounds of laughter and yelling are heard in most of the battle scenes. This also applies to natural sounds. The same sounds of birds are used in numerous places. I don't know if this is the case for all the tapes, but some of mine have little background noises and tone distortions that are not easily noticeable but that can get annoying, so that's something to beware of. Some of the names and places have been mispronounced. I understand that many of them are difficult to get out, but there is a specific way of saying them. The main problem with this set is that it has been over-abridged. The full-length unabridged reading of the LOTR, which I would also highly recommend, spans over forty cassettes, but this is only twelve. Tolkien wrote in extreme detail, all but describing every rock and tree and feature of the world he imagined. Only the most important details have been kept. Many scenes that are not critical but that sure do help have been deleted, which causes problems. Sometimes things happen that were deleted but later are referred to. For someone such as I who has read the trilogy many times over and knows exactly what's going on this is not a problem, but someone who knows little or nothing of the events chronicled in the books may have some difficulty in figuring out what's going on. Despite its drawbacks, it is a wonderful performance in a case that would look splendid on anyone's shelf. It is a bit pricy, but it is worth it. It has brought me lots of listening pleasure and helped me to get through many tough research papers. I would recommend it to those who don't mind a mixture of complete corniness and wonderful battle scenes.                                                                                      |\n",

The book starts off with frodo inside of the black gate finally but you wont get much more out of me your going to have to read it yourself. It may start slow in the first two or three chapters but after that you will not be able to put it down.

            "|Gollum: How We Made Movie Magic (The Lord of the Rings)                                      |I guess I'm a bit of a geek and I just love the character of Gollum in The lord of the Rings movies and in The Hobbit. At the same time I think Andy Serkis is a brilliant actor, with a bit of nice humor - so this book is just a great way to get a behind-the-scenes look of how this character was made. Normally I don't like to read books, but this is brilliant, informative and funny.Would recommend it to any LOTR & Hobbit fans who are interested in knowing a bit more about how it was made.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n",
            "|The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion                                                  |I've never attempted something like this,however, I was so impressed with this book I decided to give it a try.While it would have been great to have an annotated version that included the entire novel,I must say it is very easy to find your place within this book. Weather you are going from the novel to the compainon or visa versa. I am speaking from the point of view of someone very familiar with LOTR having read it numerous times over the last 30 years.And somewhat familiar with Silmarillion.I assume someone seeking this sort of information and\\or back story would have at least a minamal knowledge of the novel. Evan assuming no knowledge I believe you would quickly find your way around.I found the information to be accurate,as far as my knowledge could be trusted to check such things.One thing I've truely enjoyed is just reading random passages. I find myself reading page after page in this manner. I was just begining Unfinished Tales when I found this book and am anxious to begin reading LOTR again and make use of Reader's Companion.I would also add that the book itself is very nice. It is well made.The pages are made of nice paper with a great feel.Overall I am quite pleased and can find nothing negative to say. Again this is my first review and I hope someone finds it as useful as some of the reviews I have found helpful in the past.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",
            "|The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion                                                  |This is one of those books that you feel you must read because there will be little gems hidden throughout the multitude of pages. The authors were really hung up on the calendar and moons, which I don't care about one way or the other. Some of their explanations of terms and expressions were so common that I think everyone already knew their meanings. There were some interesting interpretations scattered around.

            "|The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion                                                  |This is one hefty tome! In contrast to the book description, it has very nearly 1,000 pages and weighs literally two and a half pounds and the text is quite dense. This is no fluffy puff piece.For anyone who loves The Lord of the Rings, this is a must-purchase companion. I'm so glad I found it and only wish it had been available when I first discovered LotR so many years ago. At the price Amazon is selling for, the publisher is practically giving the book away!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

I look forward to exploring more with this book, and would definitely recommend this to any fan of LOTR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n",

I had a book of annotations to my side and was struggling to understand chapter 3 of Stephen Dedalus's adventures on the Sandymount Strand in EireThis book is rather like that book, but I think its more of a joy to read. Although this book is not for a person who has never read the Story (it will probably give away the ending for a start!)

This book will definitely give you a greater understanding of Lord of the Rings and the author's intentions. I would have to say that its just about mandatory supplemental reading material in truly understanding Tolkien's work. It will amazed any reader how much, how far and from within, Tolkien gathered his materials to write his masterpiece. It will also surprised any reader how Lord of the Rings had been altered bit here and bit there over the various publications. So please read many of the reviews written before me, some of them are quite insightful and informative. Then if you are truly interested in Lord of the Rings as a literature, buy this book.(This book probably could be read side by side while reading Lord of the Rings but reading the book as a whole could be bit difficult.

In The Lord Of The Rings: A Reader's Companion, they have surpassed even their previous masterpiece: J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator. (As a matter of full disclosure I should mention that I met Christina Scull some years ago in London, and I have maintained a friendship with her and her husband Wayne G.Hammond ever since. Three articles I wrote for the Mensa Tolkien Special Interest Group's newsletter \"\"Beyond Bree\"\" have been referenced in A Reader's Companion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

Something that might be overlooked, however, but that deserves applause, is the publisher's use of sewn signatures for the book's binding. Very few books are made this way any more, as far as I can see, being instead bound just with glue; but a book made with sewn pages is likely to last longer and look better. The publisher is to be commended for this extra care, and encouraged to continue to use this method in subsequent printings - - especially while holding the price down so remarkably. Even at full price rather than Amazon's discount price, this book is very good value for they money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

Hammond and Christina Scull have managed to produce in this volume one of the most essential books in any Tolkien library. A READER'S COMPANION carefully annotates, line by line, chapter by chapter, Tolkien's great masterpiece.When the revised version of THE ANNOTATED HOBBIT came out in 2002 with Douglas A. Anderson's annotations, I was thrilled, as the original from 1988 was out of print. The way they handled THE HOBBIT was a large, oversized hardback, with the main text printed on wide sheets but only taking up the half closet to the binding, with the annotations on the outer edges of the sheets. The book is beautiful to hold, and it was very enlightening during rereadings of THE HOBBIT. It also noted all revisions, and gave original readings, including the original version of \"\"Riddles in the Dark\"\" chapter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n",

            "|The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion                                                  |This extensively researched and painstakingly organized reader's companion to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings is itself a masterpiece, as time will show. In over 400 pages, it contains a wealth of information for both new and seasoned readers, going far beyond just the characters, plot, and language used by the author (reflecting not only the English at the time but also the language as imagined by the author befitting of the book's characters).Reading this companion, I realized just how much thought Tolkien put into his work, writing, rewriting, and editing parts over years of dedication. When reading a work of fiction, it's easy to be taken hostage by the plot and rush through the story just to see what happens next. Little things, like words that may not make sense, or titles whose significance is not entirely understood, may not get a second thought. And names, of which Tolkien's story contains so many, from characters to places, may appear as names only, but this book reveals the meanings and reasons behind chosen names. Not to mention all the folklores and other literature that Tolkien referenced in his story and expected his readers to know. Which is why I find this book so helpful -- it deliberately slows me down, making me understand the meaning and symbolism contained in the chapter's title and a place's name as much as it helps me fully appreciate the culture of the book's characters. The Shire and elvish country, for example, just come to life with the researchers' analysis.It's no summer beach reading, but if you're fascinated by the world of Lord of the Rings, you know it's not enough just to know the plot or Heaven forbid, only watch the movies. This will help you get to a new level with Tolkien's masterpiece. Go chapter by chapter and page by page with this companion, and there's also a convenient index to help you with names you may have forgotten. Do you remember Belfalas, Dwarrowdelf, or Caradock of Llancarfan? Want to know more about Celeborn the Elf, Boromir, or the effects of elvish song on humans? Did you spot the proverbs that Tolkiens quoted in his work? Read this companion to the Lord of the Rings and find out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n",

Even so, there is much that I don't know and a lot of background that I wish I knew.I just bought this book, and am reading it while I re-read the LOTR.

I had a book of annotations to my side and was struggling to understand chapter 3 of Stephen Dedalus's adventures on the Sandymount Strand in EireThis book is rather like that book, but I think its more of a joy to read. Although this book is not for a person who has never read the Story (it will probably give away the ending for a start!) I think its pretty worthwhile for a person whos read the \"\"trilogy\"\" (of SIX Books! in three Volumes!) more than onceIf you've read Lord I think you'll really enjoy this.

All of the illustrations are by J.R.R. Tolkien himself, created while he was working on the book in the 1930s and 1940s. The illustrations have been published before, some in the first few Tolkien calendars in 1972 and 1973, others in Pictures by J.R.R. Tolkien in the late 1970s, and all of them in Christina Scull and Wayne Hammond's classic J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator.Tolkien was a gifted artist and draftsman. Even his doodles, like Shelob's Lair (drawn on a page of manuscript) in October, display a high degree of talent and precision. He was famously finicky about his drawings, insisting that each one should precisely mirror the story. (This led to his cropping some elements of some drawings, like March's Moria Gate, which displays both the full picture and the part that was trimmed off; and totally discarding others, like the abortive cityscape of Steinborg shown for September.) This perfectionism led to some absolutely beautiful productions. I am particularly fond of April's Lothlorien, showing the mallorns in full flower, and of February's view of Rivendell looking east: a tumbled landscape of stone, water, and trees.Those who have become used to the artwork of others in previous Tolkien calendars, and those whose primary view of Middle earth was shaped by the Peter Jackson films, may be a bit put off by these drawings by Tolkien himself. July's Orthanc, for example, provides a rather modest view of Saruman's tower compared to that seen in the movie. Those of us who are true lovers of Middle earth, however, will find that these drawings are especially beautiful, regardless of any intrinsic aesthetic value, because they allow us to see Tolkien's own vision as it unfolded in his mind and flowed from his pen and brush.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n",

Sure, Orthanc is less severe in Tolkien's imagination than in Jackson's film, but Orthanc was never intended to be portrayed as an evil fortress? Originally built by Men of Gondor, Orthanc served as an impregnable fortress. In Sindarin, it means `Forked Height', in reference to the four pinnacles of `hard, glossy black stone, welded into a single tower five hundred feet high'\"\".

I received this in great condition with shrink rap and a thick, sturdy, durable case in which to hold the leather bound book in. The thing I love about this edition of the LOTR trilogy is the gold trim on the edge of the pages. If ever quality were to be at its high for a book, this would be it. I have a complaint about the binding of this pristine, elegant set or collection of the LOTR trilogy. Though Houghton Mifflin published a suberb set for the 50th anniversary of the trilogy, they could've spent more time on the durability of how the book's spine would hold, more so the binding felt cheaply put together with crinkles and crackles when opened up for a read. The price is steep for the contents of the book, I would urge LOTR fans to by this if you're loyal to Tolkien lore. For people who just want to read this at a cheaper price, just by the set in paperback. Overall I like this set but wished time would have been spent on the binding and the durability. The paper could have been a little thicker like the Houghton Mifflin edition for The Hobbit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n",

If you have, read it again!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",

Also each book has it's own fold out map.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n",
            "|The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set                                                            |I ordered this from a distributor associated with Amazon and paid extra for expedited delivery. It came within 5 days and I figured that was because of the Holidays. The address label showed it being shipped from Walmart. This concerned me but the contents were in good condition. It was sold as new and I am happy with the order. The dust jackets are perfect but the outer sleeve had a little crushing. These books are a great addition to any collection. I bought them to replace the paperbacks I had that were damaged in a flood.

This is my favorite book of all time and when I got the Kindle Fire HD, I wanted this on it. I have not read it on the Kindle, so I cannot rate the Kindle version. I'm hoping there aren't any problems with it. There's not much I can say about the book itself that hasn't been said by many, many people. It is probably the most popular book of the Twentieth Century. It's a must read.

            "|The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set                                                            |There is little point in commenting on the text of this monumental, timeless classic; when you go for this version, it's all about the edition. (It is confusing that Amazon throws together all reviews of this book irrespective of editions!). The price has come down quite a bit since it was first issued, but this will still be an expensive buy by most standards, and one that raises expectations of a very well made book. These expectations are only partly met. I was very pleased with the mottled grey appearance of the coverings; the book itself feels somewhat suede like, quite pleasant, though it doesn't look or feel 'leather bound', the covering material is very thin. The book is large, heavy and seems fairly sturdy, even though the covers are maybe just a little thin in proportion to the bulk of the book. The paper is slightly cream-colored, with very little show-through, and the text is set in a clear, crisp type. Title pages have two-colored print, red and black. The gilded edges are a rich or slightly tacky detail, according to taste. Two large foldout maps are at the front and back of the book. They are kept closed by a little dot of glue, which seems unnecessary and carries the risk of damaging them when folding them out.On closer inspection there are some disappointments. The slipcase in particular seems to be put together rather indifferently. I suppose few owners will spend much time staring at the innards of this box, but at this price that is still no reason to leave it the mess that it is. Basically the slipcase is a loosely folded, prefab box with the cover-material wrapped around it. The edges inside are uneven, and outside, in my copy at least, on the front of the box surplus glue has oozed from under them. The illustrations on the back and front are not completely correctly positioned, their edges are not quite parallel to those of the box. As there are no indentations you have to give the slipcase a very firm shake to extract the book from it. The book itself lacks a headband at the bottom, a small but surprising omission that reinforces the feeling that the book was made to impress at first glance rather than from a wish to produce a truly excellent book. There is a whiff of the fake about it.I would urge people interested in a deluxe edition of LOTR to check out the one that Harper Collins published in the UK. Another reviewer has compared both editions in some detail, and I fully agree with his findings. The UK edition is less obviously spectacular, but has an understated chic that makes it more timeless. As a book, it is clearly better made than the US edition, the level of finish is indeed quite amazing. It is slightly more expensive, but definitely worth the extra outlay.

In fact, I'd read them so much that by the time the BBC cassette production was released I knew the story so well that, though I appreciated being able to hear rather than read it, I found it disturbing to listen and KNOW when words, sentences, or paragraphs were missing. :)So I was thrilled when the unabridged recordings were made, and immediately bought all four, first on cassette, then on CD. They have since given me endless hours of pleasure, and I now listen to the books at least once a year as well as still physically read the paper versions (sometimes in conjunction, if it's not possible to either listen or read at a particular time, catching up when I return to the other media).The recording was very well done and the CDs have held up wonderfully through the years (the cassettes, of course, didn't fare so well, eventually stretching and warping the sound); a terrific way to have such an exceptional story presented.And what a smart choice, or lucky chance, that resulted in Rob Inglis being the one chosen to read it; every time I listen to other narrators I'm thankful once more that Rob reads my most favorite. His different tones, speed, and styles give the characters life, and I always know who's speaking as he unfolds the tale; and what a voice! What a priceless gift ... to accomplish such a remarkable narration. I believe that Tolkien himself would have picked Rob to tell this tale. And I'm so grateful this marvelous creation of Tolkien's was made available for the ear to hear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",
            "|The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set                                                            |The LOTR trilogy is fantastic. But more on that in a moment, first a note about this three-book hardcover version (with the off-white covers). It was impossible for me to choose which edition I wanted, and I settled on this one. I was very disappointed when--despite Amazon's description--it is not illustrated by Alan Lee. There are no illustrations except Tolkien's from the original text. Otherwise, though, this is a good, durable, convient for reading, individual hardcover set. The hardcovers are a good size for reading.First time reading this since I saw the movie, second time reading.A classic of the genre that started too many clich&eacute;s of that genre. The characters are pretty flat and much of it is simplistic and silly and incredibly tedious and often confusing (hence where the films succeed with loving care). And yet, it's still wonderful. Clever and imaginative, and frankly, just stunningly beautiful in the richness of the language and the (epic) poetry of the descriptions, details, moods, and feelings. The idea of the littlest, humblest creature being in possession of great, tempting evil and his epic journey to carry the burden through a falling world in order to destroy it. Just simply fantastic storytelling with a loving appreciation for the power of words.The books get darker and richer as they move on, reflecting a deep appreciation for the reality under the fantasy--the reality of the burdens within heroism, of the darkness and oppression of evil, the grim emotions of loss and longing, a understanding of the bonds of friendship. Tolkien's epic is filled with beautiful imagery (Faramir's dreams, the dead marshes, the old forests, and most importantly, the weight of the Ring) that bring together simple (and therefore more powerful) magical fantasy with empirical reality.The last book is the best of the trilogy, rich in poetic feelings of bittersweet triumph, the sorrow and ever-lasting suffering of heroism, the renew of beauty and life in a world almost destroyed by ash and shadow, but a world that will never forget the darkness, the sadness of innocence lost and pastoral paradise that can never be returned to, and the deep bonds and devotion of friendship. Ultimately, the theme of these beautifully written epic books is that the smallest, unlikeliest person can be the grandest hero, as long as he does the best he can when fate deals him a difficult hand. And fate will deal us monstrous duties, but we must become the hero. Also, evil is evil, as is power, and it cannot be used for good. It will corrupt and destroy everything. Tolkien's beautiful poetry describes this with simple and stunning power.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n",

So, this review is regarding this version -- this edition/printing only.For a very large book this is a remarkably good paperback edition. It is a pleasure to hold and read because the cover is beautiful and the binding is strong. The pages are of sturdy paper, not flimsy tissue stuff, and the print is clear and legible. The book is solid enough that it doesn't flop loosely when held, but not too stiff either because it will remain open when laid down. I prefer hardbacks, but this paperback was a wise purchase I don't regret. AMAZING BOOK, UNFORGETTABLE STORY AND A COMPLETELY RECOMMENDED EDITION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n",

The pictures are really something; in those days it seemed almost axiomatic that there was no one fit to illustrate Lord of the Rings except (maybe) Tolkien himself. Lee proved that thesis wrong, which is a great achievement.At the same time, preparing and typesetting a new and definitive edition of Lord of the Rings, especially one with color plates, seemed like an obvious opportunity to include some of the elements that Tolkien had wanted from the beginning: Fire Letters for the Ring, leaves from the Book of Marzabul. Instead this edition doesn't even have a fold-out map.

I love every aspect of this book.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",
            "|The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set                                                            |This book, with it's leather-bound cover and gold-plated pages is a must have for anyone who enjoys reading Lord of the Rings. It compliments any collection. Without having to worry about bending the covers to an irreparable position, I was actually able to enjoy the book, instead of trying to keep the cover in pristine condition. These things mattered to me and without having to worry about them, I was happy. The ribbon bookmark was a nice touch, adding class while keeping my place at the same time.I would recommend this for anyone interested in the Lord of the Rings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

When I received the book from Amazon I was delighted with the book cover drawings and its slip case but when I began to glance through it I realised that the print quality was well below average. Then, I said to myself; &iquest;Is this the print quality that a collector's edition deserves? No, not by a long shot. You would think that this is a problem concerning only to my own copy but I've been recently checking the Amazon's excerpts of the book and they all contain the same misprints which my copy has.I really regret having spent more than fifty bucks on this book. I should've been purchased a paperback edition or the big one which contains Alan Lee's illustrations and not this waste of money. What a disappointment. Did Houghton Mifflin run out of ink when the book was being printed or what?Avoid this edition at all costs and don't believe the hype, it is not worthy. I don't know why or how it is so popular among other reviewers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

Lee was one of two Tolkien illustrators called by Peter Jackson for the making of the film. His brilliance shines through in the recreation of Rivendell and the warm feel of Hobbiton. As a life-long fan of the Lord of the Rings, I have never been disappointed by Lee's interpretation of a scene or character. His artistic skill hits the mark dead center every time on every concept. In fact, his is one artist of a few (if not the only one) who are officially recognized by Tolkien's estate as a bard of Middle Earth. Therefore, the illustrations in this beautiful edition of the best book of the 20th century are bound to appeal to you and inspire you as you read it. I heartily recommend it!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

I came to read the reviews first to see if it was worth [price] for this edition. Some had good reviews, others bad. But in the end, I decided to buy it.I haven't read the book yet. I've only flipped through the book to see if it's quality stands up to it's expensive retail price. I first thought, ok it's not that bad. It has a pretty cover and the map on the back isn't glued crooked, as someone mentioned in an earlier review, which is a relief. But as I flip to the \"\"NOTE ON THE TEXT\"\" then to \"\"THE LORD OF THE RINGS\"\" title and finally to the \"\"PROLOGUE\"\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

I borrowed it from a friend because I'd just read the trilogy and was excited to hear it enacted, but I was sorely disappointed. The man reading the part of Frodo is so completely abysmal that I had to stop listening partway through disc two. I was so psyched to hear the story enacted that if Frodo had at least been passable, I would probably have listened to the whole thing. Instead, I bought the BBC version and am quite pleased with it. One caveat is that this version does include some sections that are omitted from the BBC rendition. In my opinion, if you really want to enjoy those sections, read them in the book. If you want to listen to a well-done and entertaining audio version of these books, please buy the BBC recording instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

I was anxious to have the Kindle version for portability. I just re-read the Fellowship of the Ring in paperback before buying the Kindle version of the Trilogy. I've started and have been reading the Two Towers in the Kindle edition that I just purchased a few days ago.I'm keenly disappointed in that all the footnotes are missing. If they're present, I don't know how to access them on Kindle. In any event, a good portion of the story is missing without the footnotes. Anyone who has not previously read the Trilogy in book format will be missing a good portion of the history provided by Tolkien. Without the history, there is a lack of understanding about the story and the new reader of the Trilogy will have a lack of understanding about the complete work and how the story \"\"fits\"\" together.If you are reading the Trilogy for the first time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

I completely recommend this book to everyone in the world!READ IT! The number of pages really scares, I know, but for get the pages. The story is awesome. It talks about a totally different world. But, Tolkien describes it so well that you really believe it exists. Everything is so detailed, that you really travel reading the book! The problem is that when you finish reading it, you miss the characters, and you'll want to be reading the book forever!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n",

Or just go for the nice Folio edition.This 'leatherette' version is just fat and ugly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n",

It has black binding with red and gold Eye of Sauron and has JRR Tolkien's signature on the inside front page. It is by far the best version to date and very hard to find. The UK version comes with a CD which has JRR Tolkien reading exerpts from the story. Each volume binding has a letter of Tolkien's name.

This is the wonderful, loved, classic series in full in the palm of your hand (kindle version) to take and enjoy any time, any where!This kindle version works well on my tablet and phone and I am happy to have these great stories with me whenever I may want them.As for the stories themselves... They are timeless classics! They have been loved for generations.

JRR Tolkien's masterful storytelling, characterization and setting detail have become the benchmark to which all other epic fantasies are compared.LOTR is a classic epic storyline between good and evil. I am a big fan of epic fantasies but this one remains special. While many epic fantasy stories have been written with similar plots, few can draw the reader in so thoroughly with such engaging characters and meticulous plot details. The Fellowship of the Ring characters (Frodo, Sam, Pippin, Merry, Gimli, Boromir, Strider, Gandalf and Legolas) remain characters which I can recall details with little effort and are truly made to feel lifelike. The villain, Sauron, is known mainly through his deeds and legends but is one of the more menacing villains in epic fantasy. These characters progress through a plot of breathtaking scope and detail as the Fellowship of the Ring must confront Sauron to save Middle Earth.Tolkien's attention, if not obsession, to detail in creating the setting, Middle Earth, is unmatched in other fantasy stories which I have read. Tolkien creates such detail of the history, languages, cultures and arts of Middle Earth that the reader is immersed in Middle Earth instead of merely passing through. This detail includes extensive appendices on the history of Middle Earth which I personally have not more than skimmed but which are nonetheless illustrative of the author's attention to detail. I cannot help but think that much of this is due to his academic career in languages and literature. I cannot also help but think of how few academics could supplement such astounding detail with such entertaining storytelling that the result is the pinnacle of epic fantasy instead of a story more reminiscent of an academic thesis. The only area where Tolkien spared detail, as compared to contemporary epic fantasy, was the rules and limitations of magic. I have no issue with his lack of detail in this one area; in particular, since magic is so rarely used in the Lord of the Rings as compared to contemporary epic fantasy novels.The Hobbitis the prequel story to the Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit was written more as a Young Adult Fantasy which can be enjoyed by adult readers. The Hobbit is a simpler, but very entertaining, fantasy quest while the Lord of the Rings is an epic fantasy for adult readers which can be enjoyed equally by younger readers.This is a must read book for fans of epic fantasy stories. The movies are great but not a substitute for reading the novels which inspired the movies. The Lord of the Rings (One Volume) is 27,736 Kindle locations long excluding the extensive appendices. Standard length novels seem to run in the 4,500 to 7,000 plus Kindle location range. Longer novels, such as those in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, can range from 15,000 to 20,000 plus Kindle locations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n",

With the advent of the epic movie trilogy based on this book, new waves of readers are discovering the unique power of the &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot; It has quietly created the fantasy genre as we know it, set the tone for most fantasy ever since, topped many &quot;best book&quot; polls, and helped spawn such entertainment phenomena as &quot;Star Wars.&quot;Following up on events in &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; stars the quiet, good-natured hobbit Frodo Baggins, who has inherited a golden Ring that allows its user to become invisible. But his friend, Gandalf the wizard, informs Frodo that the Ring is really the Ring of Power, a tiny invulnerable token that the demonic Dark Lord Sauron has poured his essence and power into. And if Sauron can regain the Ring, he will be able to conquer Middle-Earth. Aghast, Frodo joins a fellowship of Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Men and a wizard, to go to the one place where the Ring can be destroyed: Mount Doom.&quot;The Two Towers&quot; begins directly after &quot;Fellowship,&quot; after Frodo Baggins flees with his friend Sam into Mordor, with no one to protect them; his cousins Merry and Pippin are kidnapped by orcs of the renegade wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli begin a frenetic search for the hobbits, and receive unexpected help from unlikely allies. Meanwhile, the Ring weighs more heavily on Frodo, as he is forced to get help from one of the people he most despised, the Ring's slave Gollum.&quot;Return of the King&quot; brings the trilogy to an action-packed, slam-bang and ultimately poignant finale. Sam barely rescues Frodo from Sauron's orcs, and the two resume their journey to Mount Doom, barely escaping Sauron's forces. As Aragorn leads the desperate battle against Sauron's armies at the city of Minas Tirith, Frodo falls increasingly under the seductive spell of the Ring.&quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; is indeed a powerful book, speaking to virtually everyone who has read it. J.R.R. Tolkien drew from legends and myths, ranging from the ancient Norse mythology to more recent legends, mingled with his love of the British country folk and his Roman Catholic beliefs. Though there are no direct linkages or lessons in the trilogy, Tolkien probably drew on his experiences in World War I for the ravaged battlefields and breakneck action sequences, and the mechanization of the countryside for the most moving passages of the book. His beliefs are equally misty but present: they fueled the ethics of the good guys, the fall of formerly-good wizard Saruman, and the themes of temptation, redemption, evil and good that run through every character.Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of how he is influenced by the Ring. Sam Gamgee is his loyal gardener, a shy young hobbit who grows in confidence and courage over the course of the trilogy. Gandalf is the quintessential wizard -- crabby, kindly, powerful, with a hidden unique streak that elevates him over the usual Obi-Wan Kenobi wizards. Merry and Pippin start out as a chirpy boy and a well-meaning flake, but are matured and made more multi-dimensional by their harrowing experiences. Aragorn is noble, kind, kingly, and intelligent, but with darker streaks in his personality that make him ultimately human. Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf initially grate on each other, but overcome their prejudices to become close friends.Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; Mordor, for example, is best described through the way that Sam and Frodo react to it. The dialogue ranges from absolutely hilarious to solemn and biblical, or to some combination of the two. And the pacing is gradual but necessary; if you don't have a good attention span, then you won't be able to handle this story. If you do, then probably you can.Even after all the years, &quot;Lord&quot; still rules the fantasy genre and has become an integral part of modern literature. It's an epic for all ages, and no one book has even come close to equalling it.|\n",

These particular editions are not ones I can imagine any discerning collector would want to own.I bought the two books because I am not a fan of Alan Lee's work and I couldn't find any other current hardback editions that used Tolkien's original drawings, (as the &quot;Leatherette&quot; Hobbit does). The truth is though that these are the most tacky and tasteless editions I've seen and the print and paper quality of both books is very poor. The colouring of the drawings in The Hobbit is a disgrace and numerous pages in my copy of the LOTR were so smudged they were unreadable.Don't buy them if you haven't already and if you've already made the mistake send them back with a complaint and write a scathing review to try and save someone else the trouble.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n",

This book will forever be remembered by the countless millions who have read it as the book which has led them to believe in hope, and in the belief that good will ultimately triumph over evil. A world which has been so lovingly crafted, that the a little detail, seemingly unimportant in the Hobbit, leads to the events unfolding in this masterpiece. Set in Middle Earth where Elves have dominance, this book sees the Dark Lord, Sauron gaining strength - and sees the Humans and their allies making a last desperate stand against the greatest evil ever written about in a book. Tolkien has woven a world so rich in detail, lovingly crafted with a beautiful history to match - which is unsurpassed until today. Tolkien weaves his story with such seamless power, so realistically, you`ll be wishing you were there, wielding a sword next to Aragorn or drinking Ent Wash with Treebeard in the shade of Mirkwood. Oh JRR, who knows what else you might have had accomplished had you still been here! And for once, this book has been done justice by a review,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n",
            "|The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set                                                            |I had bought a Lord of the Rings Leatherette Collector's Edition (the red one) before I bought this edition. When I got the Leatherette, there were NUMEROUS PROBLEMS(a page was not alligned with the others, 2 pages were bent, AND the print was horrible; faded, blurred). THIS book BLOWS the red one OUT OF THE WATER! The leather is gorgeous! It's not the cheap, ripable type. By the way, the color of the book is grayish-black-blue, but it still looks beautiful! It's VERY sturdy and tough. It's not terribly heavy. The foil stamping looks wonderful. It adds A LOT to the cover of the book! The gilded pages are so shiny that you can see your own reflection! The pages are thick, and not the cheap blinding, shiny kind used in textbooks as in the red one. I DEFINETLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ONE WHO LOVES THE MOVIES (WHICH ARE AWESOME AND VEEERY WELL MADE) AND IS A TRUE FAN OF J.R.R. TOLKIEN!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n",

The voice acting is relentlessly undignified. Many characters seem to have inexplicable speech problems as their voices range from Goofie-like to Mickey Mouse-like. If you can bear to listen to the LOTR saga reduced to squeaky weirdness (I believe the smurfs analogy in a previous review was particularly apt--this is the Lord of the Rings as performed by smurfs) then by all means choose this set. However, if you want to hear a dignified work that truly conveys a sense of the grandeur, history, and nobility of the story, then the only option is the aforementioned BBC radio edition, with Ian Holm, Peter Woodthorpe (the ultimate Gollum--he must be heard to be believed), and other top notch actors.

Tolkien's command of the English language was so vivid that his works flash across the mind like a multi-million dollar movie epic. It's unfortunate that the simple prose and even simpler plots and characters of today's fantasy have jaded someone so much that they would write a review such as the &quot;Annoying Drivel&quot; review. The Lord of the Rings is truly literature, not material meant for the video game mentality. Perhaps the author of &quot;Annoying Drivel&quot; should take some advanced college level literature courses and then come back to the books. They have delighted me for more than 30 years, and I judge all other fantasy by its ability to live up to Tolkien's descriptive power, plot, and character development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

At eight, most kids are too young to read and fully comprehend the book themselves, but they will enjoy the story, learn a tremendous amount of language, and appreciate the time spent with them.Later they'll have fond, sentimental memories of the book and will reread your gift to them on their own. This is good because the story has it all: love, beauty, nature, hard work, perseverance, courage, good over evil, adventure, every important lesson you'd ever hope to teach them--all told better than you ever could.This book is absolutely guaranteed to offset the negative influence of bad neighbor kids, poor teachers, The Jerry Springer Show, and your own parental shortcomings. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n",

So I was really happy to be able to download this version of LOTR onto my Kindle TouchThe Lord of the Rings. I'm basically very happy with the Kindle version. The only negative comment I have is that the maps are extremely small and difficult to read. I have to have my paperback copy of LOTR next to me (which is a larger size paperback) so I can refer to the maps. It would be nice if the Kindle offered some kind of feature where you could zoom in on the maps to enlarge them and/or navigate around them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n",

Tolkien. This book displays literary skill and uses the English language in a narrative form and in a candid and colloquial format that shows the way people commonly speak in the countryside of England and the also within the higher end of the social hierarchy.The book does a great effort to bisect the cultural heritage of the English populace. The book does well to encompass the aspects of wealth and poverty and says good things abut both sections of culture and society.

But this version and cover are good enough!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

Then I watch part I and III and decided that this book had to be in my collection. LOTRs must be the first fantasy novel that I won't hesitate to recommend anyone to read and enjoy it. The plot is even better than The Hobbit, of course, but more importantly, this book brings me joy, sadness, sympathy, excitement, and love. Middle Earth is like a dreaming land which attracts every readers and I think everybody never stops dreaming about it. The ending is so sweet and satisfying that it made me smile after closing the book. Who can resist sir Tolkien after all?With LOTRs, sir J. R. R. Tolkien deserves to be the best author of the fantasy novel group. It must take a very long long time for another one to replace his position. I admit that I'm already a crazy fan of him and each guy in the \"\"fellowship of the ring\"\"! I have no doubt that LOTRs is the best and a must-read for everyone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n",

It came unwrapped (not protected for shipping), but arrived in ok condition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",

Since I live in Turkey, I wasn't sure how the shipping process would work, or if I'd be able to receive it before the end of this year. I ordered the book on September 18, Amazon gave me an estimated delivery date between mid-October and early November. You can imagine my surprise when I got the notification that the mail was here on September 29! Well Done Amazon!About the book, I haven't yet the opportunity to read it, since I just got it, but I have readily read the books I don't know how many times and know for a fact that this is just a spectacular classic. A quick peak at the pages and I can tell you that the book feels solid and well made. The gilded edges and leather cover sure does add a feel of quality and a bit of \"\"bling\"\" to it. You also get two foldout two-color maps and color insert showing leaves from the Book of Mazarbul.In all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n",

The investment was well worth it. The binding is sturdy, and the pages are suitably thick.The extra maps were a nice touch, but the color plates of the Book of Mazarbul were completely unnecessary and inconsistent since the rest of the book is devoid of all but the basic illustration that are present in previous editions.Also, some of the excess gold glitter on the edges of the pages came off on my hands during reading for the first few months of my ownership.The important thing to me is having confidence that the edition will survive the test of time, and I am confident of that. As I am reading the story to my daughter, I hope too that she will be able to read it to her own children someday without fearing that the book will come apart in her hands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n",

I have listened to hundreds of audio books, and the only one better is Jim Dale's performing of the Harry Potter books. I have recommended this collection of CDs to many friends, and I recommend it to you: you will not be disappointed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

I got this set of audio book disks for driving across the country with. It was a good buy in my opinion.Inglis does a masterful job of reading the books. Before I bought the collection, I wondered how good it could possibly be with only one person doing EVERY VOICE. He does a great job with it all though. His voice while \"\"reading\"\" is smooth and easy to listen too.

I'd expected a few pictures here and there, but there are pictures about every 40 pages or so throughout the entire book! The size is not too cumbersome, and the book is easily portable despite containing all three books. I had worried that it might be too big to take with me places, and I've seen some versions that contained all three books in one volume that were definitely too big to lug around. This one is not.

Sure, I'm 31 and have been re-reading LOTR since I was about 7 or 8 yrs old. I've owned crappy paperbacks and loaned them out, at some point I had a hardcover 1 volume edition, which got ruined in a basement flood. I love Alan Lee's work. THIS IS A MUST OWN. I cannot sum it up any other way, the print is 1000 times more readable (font looks nice too by the way) , each volume has a satin ribbon book mark, the inside covers (F+B) bear a 2 color (black and red) map of third age middle earth, and the illustrations are so pretty they, well, they will fire up the imagination station and make the read all the more pleasurable. Sure, I'd love to see a John Howe edition as well, but this three volume illustrated edition is nothing short of beautiful. Spend some time in your study, with a good 12 year single malt, and you will enjoy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

They are top-quality, with glossy paper and come in a very sturdy box. However, they books are a LOT larger and heavier than I expected, which is fine, but would definitely make reading them difficult. It would be a burden to have to carry them around, as each individual book is surprisingly heavy. However, they are great collector's items, meant to last. I bought them because they look nice, and I wanted to own a better copy of this magnificent series other than my old beaten up paperback editions. (I will still use the paperbacks for re-reading, though!)Even so, they are wonderful copies, and I highly recommend them if you are looking for a nice edition to collect or display. I think it would have been better if they made these books more practical, though, as nice as they are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n",
