# Finding Similar Book Reviews
This project implements a system to find similar pairs of book reviews from the **Amazon Books Review dataset** using scalable algorithms. The primary goal is to compute textual similarity efficiently, even on large datasets, using **Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)** combined with **MinHashing** and **Jaccard Similarity**.
